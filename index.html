    <p>My name is Lynn and I grew up in St. Louis with a mother with was terrified to fly, scared of bridges and untrusting of bus or train rides.
        I spent my entire childhood not knowing the joys of traveling. I took my first real vacation in Sept. 2012. 
        I flew on my first airplane and I was terrified, just like mom. Unlike my mom, I did not let my fears keep me from trying things that scared me.
        Off I went to Orlando, Florida.
    </p>
    <p>The plane was a little shakey, but overall flying was not bad. The next hurdle was overcoming the thought of enormous ocean. This was  also my first time cruising. 
        I arrived at Port Canaveral to see the biggest ship I had ever seen. We boraded the ship and begin to set sail on the open sea. The ocean was truly breathtaking. Water
        as far my eyes could see and the ship was beautiful. </p>
    <p>That vacation turned out to be the best 5 days I had ever spent away from home. I have went on to take 3 more cruises. I takee a flight to a new place almost every year for my 
        birthday's. I want to see as many American cities as I possibly can.

    <p>I have cruised to the Bahamas, which was absoluetely amazing!</p>

    <p>I have come to love something that was once terrifying to me. I was able to overcome a afear and it has turned into my greatest love. I just want to tell
        my story and hopefully insipre someone to try something scary, even generationally scary. You never know, it may become your greatest love too!
